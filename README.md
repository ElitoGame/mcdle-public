## Translations

This repo contains the translations of MCdle. I will keep english and german up to date, everything else is community based, so feel free to contribute! Pull requests are welcome, for new languages, fixes or updates!

### How to contribute to the translations

Optionally but recommended - join the MCdle [discord server](https://discord.gg/3rDDPcFd4f) and open a Post in the #translations forum channel to let me know what you are working on. There we can discuss any questions you might have and you might even get some translation help from others!

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Open [mcdle.net/translate_mcdle](https://www.mcdle.net/translate_mcdle) and click `Generate`.
4. Pick a target language (the one you want to translate into) - this is used for generating the item names as well as the file name
5. Pick a base language (will choose an available translation to provide you with some basics)
6. Optional, but recommended: you can enable marking likely edits of the item names and printing the resulting json in pretty formatting.
7. Now you can hit `Generate Translation`. This will load up the translation for preview below. Scroll down to download/copy it.
8. Make your translation changes and look for any _[TODO]_ messages in the file.
9. Verify your work by going to the page again, choosing `Paste` at the top, paste your translation and click preview.
10. If everything in the preview looks good - commit your changes and open a pull request.

## Asset modifications

Any commit that modifies the assets will be marked with emojis accordingly.
